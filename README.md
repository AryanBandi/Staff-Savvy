# Staff-Savvy
Sightreading practice app made with Unity engine and C#


This app is made by Aryan Bandi and is designed to help musicians practice sightreading. The current version works as a note identifier, and future ideas include implementation of tenor clef, finger patterns + positions instead of note names, and the inclusion of a more notes on the staff.
